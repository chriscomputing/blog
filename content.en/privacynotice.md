## Hosting
Our hosting provider collects the following data in so-called log files, which your browser transmits:

IP address, the address of the previously visited website (referrer request header), date and time of the request, time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time, content of the request, HTTP status code, data volume transferred, website from which the request originated, and information about the browser and operating system.

This is necessary to display our website and to ensure stability and security. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.

No tracking takes place, and we do not have direct access to this data.

We use the following hosting provider to provide our website:

GitHub Inc.  
88 Colin P Kelly Jr St  
San Francisco, CA 94107  
United States  

This entity is the recipient of your personal data. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR, as it relieves us from having to maintain servers on our premises. The server location is the USA.
